# Chat Streaming and Markdown Support

## Overview

The chat interface now supports real-time streaming of AI responses and full markdown rendering capabilities.

## Features

### 1. Streaming Responses
- **Real-time feedback**: Users see the AI's response as it's being generated, character by character
- **No more waiting**: Instead of staring at a loading spinner, users can start reading the response immediately
- **Smooth updates**: Messages are updated in-place as new content arrives

### 2. Markdown Support
The AI assistant's messages now support full markdown formatting:

- **Bold text**: `**text**` renders as bold
- **Italic text**: `*text*` renders as italic
- **Headers**: `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, etc.
- **Lists**: Both ordered (`1. Item`) and unordered (`- Item`)
- **Code blocks**: Inline code with backticks and fenced code blocks
- **Links**: `[text](url)` creates clickable links
- **Blockquotes**: `> Quote` for emphasized text
- **Line breaks**: Proper spacing between paragraphs

### 3. Custom Styling
All markdown elements are styled to match the app's theme:
- Headers have appropriate sizing and spacing
- Code blocks have syntax highlighting backgrounds
- Links are styled in blue and open in new tabs
- Lists have proper indentation
- Dark mode support for all elements

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
- Updated `ChatOpenAI` to use `streaming: true`
- Modified chat functions to use `.stream()` instead of `.invoke()`
- Added IPC channels for streaming chunks: `CHAT_STREAM_CHUNK` and `CHAT_STREAM_END`
- Each chunk is sent to the frontend as it arrives

### Frontend Changes
- Added `ReactMarkdown` component for rendering markdown
- Updated message handlers to accumulate streaming chunks
- Messages are updated in real-time as chunks arrive
- Custom component renderers for consistent styling
- Removed loading spinner in favor of showing partial content

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Instant feedback**: Users see text appearing immediately
2. **Better readability**: Formatted text with proper headers, lists, and emphasis
3. **Professional appearance**: AI responses look polished and well-structured
4. **Reduced anxiety**: No more wondering if the AI is still working

## Example Markdown Output

The AI might respond with something like:

```markdown
I'd be happy to help you refine your project idea! **Your task management app** sounds interesting.

Here are a few questions to help clarify the concept:

1. **Target Audience**: Who is this app designed for?
   - Individual users for personal tasks?
   - Teams in a business setting?
   - Specific industries or professions?

2. **Key Features**: What would make your app stand out?
   - AI-powered task prioritization
   - Integration with other tools
   - Unique visualization methods

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   ```
   - Mobile-first or desktop-first?
   - Real-time collaboration needed?
   - Offline functionality required?
   ```

This will render with proper formatting, making it easy for users to read and understand the AI's questions and suggestions.
